The Therapeutic Communities are gaining more and more space in the field of national public policies for the care of people who abuse drugs. Such institutions usually employ in the treatment, among other things, religious/spiritual elements that are almost always linked to direct and indirect incentives to the Religious Conversion of the inmates. Little is known, however, about the effect of these practices on the recovery and maintenance of abstemiousness among egresses. This study tried to measure such effects and understand what role Conversion played in the analyzed cases. It was assumed that it would not produce effects and that its presence would not be necessary or sufficient to produce the desired results and that other conditions, such as sociability, would be more effective. The data to test the hypotheses formulated here were obtained through an online survey applied at national level with egresses from Therapeutic Communities and analyzed using the R software. The technique used for analysis was the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Causal formulas obtained in the analyzes revealed that the Recovery was caused by the Absence of Conversion and that Abstemia only happened in the Presence of Support Networks and the Absence of Conversion. In addition, an attempt was made to trace the genesis of these institutions in Brazil, having as a starting point their encounters and disagreements with instances of the public, governmental and private spheres.
